Project Overview
As the world moves toward sustainable energy, wind energy plays a critical role in reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. However, wind energy generation can be highly variable due to changing environmental conditions. This project aims to build machine learning models that predict wind energy generation based on historical data, allowing for better planning and energy grid management.

Objectives:
- Predict wind energy generation based on weather data (e.g., wind speed, temperature, pressure).
- Provide a scalable solution that can be adapted to different regions and datasets.
- Aid in efficient management of renewable energy grids by providing accurate forecasting.

Features
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess historical wind energy and weather data.
- Machine Learnin: Implement machine learning algorithms such as "XGBoost" to predict wind energy generation.
- Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using RMSE, MAE, and other relevant metrics.
- Visualization: Graphs and plots to visualize actual vs predicted energy generation.

 Technologies Used
- Python: Core programming language for model development.
- Flask: Lightweight web framework used for deploying the model.
- XGBoost: A high-performance machine learning algorithm for predictive modeling.
- Pandas & NumPy: Libraries for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: For model development and experimentation.

 Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mishalma/predication-of-renewal-energy-generation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd predication-of-renewal-energy-generation
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

 Usage

Running the Model
Once the environment is set up, you can run the Flask application to interact with the wind energy prediction model.

1. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the web interface for the wind energy prediction model.

 Direct Model Use
You can also run the machine learning model directly through the provided Jupyter notebooks to experiment with different datasets or tweak the model parameters.

 Dataset

The dataset includes:
wind energy dataset(from kaggle)
Make sure to adjust the data paths and preprocessing steps as necessary to fit your dataset.

Model Details
The machine learning model uses the following algorithms:
- XGBoost: Optimized for high performance and accuracy in wind energy prediction tasks.
  
 Evaluation Metrics:
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

These metrics help determine the accuracy of the wind energy generation prediction.

Results

The current implementation shows that the "XGBoost" model performs well in predicting wind energy generation, with an RMSE of 2.05, indicating strong predictive power. The model's performance allows for reliable forecasts, which can assist in better grid management and resource allocation.
